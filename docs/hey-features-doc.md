# Hey.com Feature Matrix

A mapping of Hey.com UI features to their MCP tool (if any). Useful when deciding what to implement next or tracing a UI action to its tool.

Tool definitions and parameters live in [`TOOLS.md`](TOOLS.md). Endpoint details and the authoritative changelog live in [`API.md`](API.md). Where the tables below and `API.md` disagree, trust `API.md`.
